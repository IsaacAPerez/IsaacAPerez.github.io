<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
<p>
  By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Isaac Perez.
</p>
<p>
  Isaac Perez is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.
</p>
<p>
  The CurbSide app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
</p>

<p><strong>For Vendors</strong></p>
<p>
  If you use CurbSide as a vendor, you are responsible for ensuring that all information you provide about your business, products, and services is accurate and up to date. You agree not to post misleading information about your location, hours, or offerings.
</p>

<p><strong>Location Services</strong></p>
<p>
  CurbSide requires location services to function. You should be aware that there are certain things that Isaac Perez will not take responsibility for. The app requires an active internet connection and location services. Isaac Perez cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to these services.
</p>

<p><strong>Data Charges</strong></p>
<p>
  If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app.
</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>
<p>
  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Isaac Perez does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device.
</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p>
  I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
</p>
<p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-01-14</p>
