  <strong>SMS Consent</strong>

  <p>
    CurbSide uses SMS only for account verification and security. We send one-time
    verification codes through Twilio to confirm your phone number.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Opt-In</strong></p>
  <p>
    You opt in by entering your phone number in the CurbSide app and requesting a
    verification code. By submitting your number, you consent to receive SMS messages
    for verification.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Message Usage</strong></p>
  <p>
    SMS messages are used solely to deliver verification codes and related security
    notices. We do not send marketing or promotional SMS messages.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Opt-Out</strong></p>
  <p>
    You can opt out at any time by replying STOP to any verification message.
    After opting out, you will no longer receive SMS verification codes unless you
    opt in again in the app.
